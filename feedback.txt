Notes: 

It works great! Awesome.

Perhaps there is a more concise way of organizing the logic in the event listener, so we don't have to repeat the same logic for each id, class etc. If so, I think that logic could be reduced to a few lines of code!

Could be helpful to use a "disabled" attribute on the buttons, if there are no more prizes. This would better prevent a user from trying to click on a button.
